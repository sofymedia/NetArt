Art of Death,"This course examines the history of art with respect to the subject of death and the range of allegorical, figurative, literal, religious and documentary approaches used to frame it. Though our discussions will allude to ancient and global frameworks around the subject, our study will focus on modern Western art and creations in which elements of the macabre, ornamentation, documentation, Romanticism, phantasmagoria, and other responses to mortality will be closely examined. In addition to tracing a particular visual language and recurring aesthetic of death among a broad range of artworks-representative of different media, conceptual approaches, time periods, etc.-we will discuss these works against relevant theoretical positions expressed by Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, Craig Dworkin, Sigmund Freud, Amy Herzog, Didier Maleuvre, and others, to identify the roles that art plays in articulating the indefinable, and the persistent importance of death as a subject of creative reflection and study. Readings and assignments, gallery and museum visits, will require several hours of time outside of class.",Art,Pessimist,SVA,
Art of the Steal,"Picasso's famous idiom ""Good artists borrow, great artists steal"" summarizes much more than his own personal work and conviction. It encapsulates centuries of phenomena that have occurred between cultures and individuals who influenced, cross-pollinated, borrowed and, most importantly, stole from one another. In this course we will cover periods ranging from the ancient Greco-Roman, to the medieval, modernity and postmodernity, as well as the contemporary art world. Topics include visual art, literature and occasionally music. We will address the inevitable problematics that occur with cultural appropriation, but mainly focus our studies on appropriation and influence among artists. Readings will be assigned weekly and each session will consist of lectures and class discussions.",Art,Adventurous,SVA,
Erotic Literature,"This course will focus on selections from the great erotic literature from ancient Greece to modern times in a variety of genres, themes and styles.

Readings will include a licentious Greek comedy presented as anti-war protest; bawdy fabliaux from the Middle Ages and salacious sonnets from the 16th century; an irreverent and sacrilegious 18th century anti-Platonic dialogue; a novella depicting Christ's resurrection into ""blood consciousness""; a sexually explicit celebration of love, art and Bohemian life; a collection of short stories solicited as porn for a dollar a page; a love letter, written in novel form, as a challenge to a paramour who claimed women could not write erotica; a version of a classic, romantic fairy tale transmuted into a B&D fantasy set in the Middle Ages. Students will gain an appreciation of the many protean forms of erotica from comedy to agitprop.",Art,Romantic/Joyous,SVA,
Literature of Self-Knowledge,"""Who am I, standing in the midst of this thought-traffic?"" wondered the Sufi poet Rumi. Achieving self-knowledge is a challenge not only because our perception of self may not always jibe with the tenuous labels that society imposes on us, but also because self-revelation may sometimes be terrifying. This course draws upon fiction, film and art to reflect upon the daunting task of ""knowing oneself"" with guidance from thinkers like Socrates and Simone de Beauvoir. We will read works by authors such as Clarice Lispector, James Baldwin, Lorrie Moore and Mahmoud Darwish, who will lead us into the unmapped labyrinths of self by discussing racial-ethnic consciousness, sexual identity, transfiguration and self-accountability. We will also view such films as Moonlight, as well as discuss art, in particular, self-portraits and ""selfies.""",Self-Awareness,Curious,SVA,
Poetic Justice,"What is justice? Who deserves to be punished? What laws should govern us? Philosophers and legal scholars have long contemplated these questions, and for some writers and artists they provide urgency to inspiration. In this course we will look at what ""justice"" might mean and how writers and artists have provoked and created when the gap between law and justice unravels. We'll look at how writers from Sophocles in ""Antigone"" to Franz Kafka question what is just when the law isn't. We'll look at writers and poets who have found themselves writing from prisons, from Nelson Mandela to members of Pussy Riot, as well as the work of currently incarcerated writers and artists, and those responding to contemporary questions of justice, including Rhodessa Jones, founder of the Medea Project: Theater for Incarcerated Women, and prison abolitionist Mariam Kaba.",Self-Awareness,Curious,SVA,
